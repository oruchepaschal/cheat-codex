# Cheat Codex (Otherwise known as a Cheat Sheet)

Welcome to the DevOps Cheat Sheet! DevOps is a powerful set of practices that enable organizations to deliver applications and services at speeds never before possible. This codex is a continuously updated collection of cheat sheets for dependencies, frameworks, languages, and runtimes such as Git, Bash, Javascript etc. New items are regularly added to the list.

## Breakdown of Codex
* <em>Git Codex:</em>
Git is a system that helps multiple people work on files together, tracking changes and coordinating work. It is mainly used for software development, but can be used for any set of files.

* <em>SQL Codex:</em>
SQL is a database language used to create, maintain, and access data from a database. It is used to manipulate stored data and create new databases and tables.

* <em>Docker:</em>
Docker is a program that allows you to run applications securely and isolated from the rest of the system. It provides a way to package and deploy applications quickly, regardless of the environment.


## Getting Started
The cheat sheets are all written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) using a tabular view style. Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like `#` or `*`. You can learn more about Markdown in GitHub's Guide on [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

You can clone the cheat sheet(s) to your local machine or fork the cheat sheet(s) to your remote repository. They can be used as guides that can be referenced when the need arises during your programming sessions.

## Contributing
Cheat Sheets is still an evolving project with a lot of work still required to make it outstanding. Contributions are welcome to Cheat Sheets in the form of error-correction, cheat sheet addition or any other form of contribution to make Cheat Sheets industry standard.

If you'd like to contribute code to Cheat Sheets, please do the following:


1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new topic branch off the master branch
3. Commit and push the branch
4. Make a pull request describing what you have done
5. Now it will hopefully get merged

**Note**: For now there is no styling guide for Cheat Sheets, but you can look through the various cheat sheets to have a feel of the styles that were adopted in creating the cheat sheets.

Here's some links to resources on how to fork a repository and open a Pull Request:

- [Getting started with forking a repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)  
- [Creating a pull request from a fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)

We are very responsive to contributors, and review every patch we receive fairly quickly. Most contributors who successfully get a patch or two applied are given write access to the repositories and invited to join the Cheat Sheets' development team. Since we view every user as potential contributor, this approach works well for us.

So if you want to help out with Cheat Sheets, we'll be glad to accept your efforts!
